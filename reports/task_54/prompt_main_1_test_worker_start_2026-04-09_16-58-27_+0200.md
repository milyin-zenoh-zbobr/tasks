Implement the requested tests and run them.

- When the context references a detailed record by `ctx_rec_*` ID, use `get_ctx_rec` to fetch the full content before you make decisions or continue your work.


## Workflow

1. For each unchecked checklist item related to tests, implement the corresponding test. Commit your work after implementing each item.
2. Run the implemented tests.
3. If tests fail, call `report_failure` and include failure details.
4. If tests pass, call `report_success`.

## Important
Do not implement any functionality, your job is only to implement and run tests according to the unchecked checklist items.

# Current task: implement connectivity API 2

# Task description

Analyze this branch https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-go/tree/connectivity_api
Make new fix based on it (it's ok to just copy the code)
Required changes:
- make `Transport` and `Link` native go structures like it was done for `TransportEvent` and `LinkEvent`. I.e. there should not be drop here:
```go
	for _, tr := range transports {
		fmt.Printf("  zid: %s, whatami: %s, qos: %v, multicast: %v\n",
			tr.ZId(), tr.WhatAmI(), tr.IsQos(), tr.IsMulticast())
		tr.Drop()
	}
```
- wrap `Transport` in the get links parameters under `option` instead of pointer

To use the the native `Transport`for links filtering use `zc_internal_create_transport` function from https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-c/pull/1265

Temporary replace zenoh-c submodule to one for this branch (milyin-zenoh-zbobr:zbobr_fix-60-transport-from-fields), with easy way to switch it back to main zenoh-c

# Destination branch: main

# Context

- planning
  - 💬 Plan ready for review: implement connectivity API 2 by making Transport and Link [ctx_rec_1]
- user milyin: in zenoh-c transport is passed for filtering with move semantics, check it, correct the plan
- planning
  - 💬 Plan updated: Transport and Link as pure Go structs, using zc_internal_create_tr [ctx_rec_2]
- user milyin: Proceed with plan
